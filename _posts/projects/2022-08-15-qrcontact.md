As a fun side project, I built a small [web app](http://atharvabhagwat.pythonanywhere.com/) using the pyqrcode and vobject libraries. The idea was simple: make it easier to share contact information with just a QR code.
The app generates a QR code with your details, which can be scanned and saved as a contact instantly! No typing required! Privacy was my main focus, so none of your information is stored anywhere.

If you notice any issues or have feature suggestions, feel free to open an [issue on github](https://github.com/atharva-bhagwat/qrcontact/issues).

## Bonus for macOS and iOS users

- Use [this](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9f8e2d64c5804d8abbee808aae8c2853) shortcut to access the QR code with one click!
- Create an album named `Contact` with the QR code in it.
