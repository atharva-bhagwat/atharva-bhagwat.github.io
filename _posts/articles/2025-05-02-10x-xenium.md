## Overview of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)

Traditional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dissociates cells and profiles gene expression at single cell resolution. It is able to capture the heterogeneity within tissues and gives high resolution insight into cellular functions.

While this type of data can be used to analyze variations in gene expression, it lacks the spatial information for cells, which adds a dimension of information. Enter ‘Spatial Transcriptomics’! Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our ability to understand biology by capturing the spatial information. Having spatial context allows us to look deeper into cell-cell interactions, cellular niches, and various microenvironments across conditions.

Over the last 6 years, spatial transcriptomics technologies have advanced at a rapid speed and these come with various advantages. Here is a list of a few ST technologies:

## Overview of Xenium

Xenium is a commercialized technology of 10x genomics. It uses RNA based transcripts and can target up to 5000 genes. Xenium v2 has nuclear and cell membrane staining which are used for cell segmentation, as compared to v1 which only had nuclear staining and detected cells based on cell-boundary expansion.
