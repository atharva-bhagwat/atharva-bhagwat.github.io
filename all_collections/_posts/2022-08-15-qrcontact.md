While playing around I came across `pyqrcode` and `vobject` libraries in python. So I made an [web app](https://contactqr.herokuapp.com/) which will make sharing your contact information easy with a QR code. You'll be able to download a QR code with your contact information which when scaned will save your contact with just one click! All your information is completely private and not stored at all (This was the main reason I made the app).

If you find a bug or have a feature suggestion please raise it [here](https://github.com/atharva-bhagwat/qrcontact/issues). Please try to be as descriptive as possible.


## Bonus for macOS and iOS users:
**watchOS does not support `find photos` in a shortcut :(**
- Use [this](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9f8e2d64c5804d8abbee808aae8c2853) shortcut to access the QR code with one click!
- Create an album named `Contact` with the QR code.
