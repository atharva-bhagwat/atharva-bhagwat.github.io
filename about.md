<!-- <p>
Hi! My name is Atharva Bhagwat. I am a student at Tandon School of Engineering, NYU studying for a masters in computer science. Before that I worked as a ML engineer at ResoluteAI.in. My areas of interest are machine learning, computational biology, and their intersection.

    > Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    > I joined ResoluteAI.in as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern in July 2020, I worked on building vairous proof of concepts and converting them into APIs for the AI Lab. After completing my 3 month internship period I was hired full-time as Machine Learning Engineer. During this time I designed, developed, and deployed a computer vision solution for yeild counting and anomaly detection in textile industry. This experience has helped me approach AI solutions which not only are doable but are also scalable.
