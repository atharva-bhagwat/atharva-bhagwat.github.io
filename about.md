This is long bio.
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    > I joined ResoluteAI.in as a Machine Learning Engineer: Intern in July 2020, I worked on building vairous Proof of Concepts and converting them into an API for  the AI Lab. After completing my 3 month internship period I was hired full-time as Machine Learning Engineer. During this time I had the opportunity to work on developing Proof of Concepts for automating certain aspects of the textile industry. I also had the opportunity to work on client's site to design and develop a system to automate their workflow. Even as a ML Engineer I had the opportunity to learn the buisness side of things. This has given the understanding to think of AI solutions which not only are doable but are also scalable.
